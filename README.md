# solidity-token-contract
This project implements a basic ERC-20-like token in Solidity, featuring public variables for token details, a mapping for address balances, a mint function to create tokens, and a burn function to destroy tokens. It's a foundational contract for understanding token development on the Ethereum blockchain.
